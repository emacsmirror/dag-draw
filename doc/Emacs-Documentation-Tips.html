<span id="index-tips-for-documentation-strings"></span>
<span id="index-conventions-for-documentation-strings"></span>

<span id="index-checkdoc_002dminor_002dmode"></span>
<p>Here are some tips and conventions for the writing of documentation
strings.  You can check many of these conventions by running the command
<kbd>M-x checkdoc-minor-mode</kbd>.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Every command, function, or variable intended for users to know about
should have a documentation string.

</li><li> An internal variable or subroutine of a Lisp program might as well
have a documentation string.  Documentation strings take up very
little space in a running Emacs.

</li><li> Format the documentation string so that it fits in an Emacs window on an
80-column screen.  It is a good idea for most lines to be no wider than
60 characters.  The first line should not be wider than 74 characters,
or it will look bad in the output of <code>apropos</code>.

<span id="index-emacs_002dlisp_002ddocstring_002dfill_002dcolumn"></span>
<p>You can fill the text if that looks good.  Emacs Lisp mode fills
documentation strings to the width specified by
<code>emacs-lisp-docstring-fill-column</code>.  However, you can sometimes
make a documentation string much more readable by adjusting its line
breaks with care.  Use blank lines between sections if the
documentation string is long.
</p>
</li><li> The first line of the documentation string should consist of one or two
complete sentences that stand on their own as a summary.  <kbd>M-x
apropos</kbd> displays just the first line, and if that line&rsquo;s contents don&rsquo;t
stand on their own, the result looks bad.  In particular, start the
first line with a capital letter and end it with a period.

<p>For a function, the first line should briefly answer the question,
&ldquo;What does this function do?&rdquo;  For a variable, the first line should
briefly answer the question, &ldquo;What does this value mean?&rdquo;  Prefer to
answer these questions in a way that will make sense to users and
callers of the function or the variable.  In particular, do <em>not</em>
tell what the function does by enumerating the actions of its code;
instead, describe the role of these actions and the function&rsquo;s
contract.
</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t limit the documentation string to one line; use as many lines as
you need to explain the details of how to use the function or
variable.  Please use complete sentences for the rest of the text too.
</p>
</li><li> When the user tries to use a disabled command, Emacs displays just the
first paragraph of its documentation string&mdash;everything through the
first blank line.  If you wish, you can choose which information to
include before the first blank line so as to make this display useful.

</li><li> The first line should mention all the important arguments of the
function (in particular, the mandatory arguments), and should mention
them in the order that they are written in a function call.  If the
function has many arguments, then it is not feasible to mention them
all in the first line; in that case, the first line should mention the
first few arguments, including the most important arguments.

</li><li> When a function&rsquo;s documentation string mentions the value of an argument
of the function, use the argument name in capital letters as if it were
a name for that value.  Thus, the documentation string of the function
<code>eval</code> refers to its first argument as &lsquo;<samp>FORM</samp>&rsquo;, because the
actual argument name is <code>form</code>:

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">Evaluate FORM and return its value.
</pre></div>

<p>Also write metasyntactic variables in capital letters, such as when you
show the decomposition of a list or vector into subunits, some of which
may vary.  &lsquo;<samp>KEY</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>VALUE</samp>&rsquo; in the following example
illustrate this practice:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">The argument TABLE should be an alist whose elements
have the form (KEY . VALUE).  Here, KEY is ...
</pre></div>

</li><li> Never change the case of a Lisp symbol when you mention it in a doc
string.  If the symbol&rsquo;s name is <code>foo</code>, write &ldquo;foo&rdquo;, not
&ldquo;Foo&rdquo; (which is a different symbol).

<p>This might appear to contradict the policy of writing function
argument values, but there is no real contradiction; the argument
<em>value</em> is not the same thing as the <em>symbol</em> that the
function uses to hold the value.
</p>
<p>If this puts a lower-case letter at the beginning of a sentence
and that annoys you, rewrite the sentence so that the symbol
is not at the start of it.
</p>
</li><li> Do not start or end a documentation string with whitespace.

</li><li> <strong>Do not</strong> indent subsequent lines of a documentation string so
that the text is lined up in the source code with the text of the first
line.  This looks nice in the source code, but looks bizarre when users
view the documentation.  Remember that the indentation before the
starting double-quote is not part of the string!

</li><li> <span id="index-quoting-apostrophe-and-grave-accent-in-doc-strings"></span>
<span id="index-apostrophe_002c-quoting-in-documentation-strings"></span>
<span id="index-grave-accent_002c-quoting-in-documentation-strings"></span>
<span id="index-escaping-apostrophe-and-grave-accent-in-doc-strings"></span>
When documentation should display an ASCII apostrophe or grave accent,
use &lsquo;<samp>\\='</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>\\=`</samp>&rsquo; in the documentation string literal so
that the character is displayed as-is.

</li><li> In documentation strings, do not quote expressions that are not Lisp symbols,
as these expressions can stand for themselves.  For example, write
&lsquo;<samp>Return the list (NAME TYPE RANGE) ...</samp>&rsquo; instead of
&lsquo;<samp>Return the list `(NAME TYPE RANGE)' ...</samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp>Return the list \\='(NAME TYPE RANGE) ...</samp>&rsquo;.

<span id="Docstring-hyperlinks"></span></li><li> <span id="index-curly-quotes-1"></span>
<span id="index-curved-quotes-1"></span>
When a documentation string refers to a Lisp symbol, write it as it
would be printed (which usually means in lower case), with a grave
accent &lsquo;<samp>`</samp>&rsquo; before and apostrophe &lsquo;<samp>'</samp>&rsquo; after it.  There are
two exceptions: write <code>t</code> and <code>nil</code> without surrounding
punctuation.  For example:

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">CODE can be `lambda', nil, or t.
</pre></div>

<p>Note that when Emacs displays these doc strings, Emacs will usually
display &lsquo;<samp>`</samp>&rsquo; (grave accent) as &lsquo;<samp>‘</samp>&rsquo; (left single quotation
mark) and &lsquo;<samp>'</samp>&rsquo; (apostrophe) as &lsquo;<samp>’</samp>&rsquo; (right single quotation
mark), if the display supports displaying these characters.
See <a href="Keys-in-Documentation.html">Substituting Key Bindings in Documentation</a>.  (Some previous versions of this section
recommended using the non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> single quotation marks
directly in doc strings, but this is now discouraged, since that leads
to broken help string displays on terminals that don&rsquo;t support
displaying those characters.)
</p>
<span id="index-hyperlinks-in-documentation-strings"></span>
<p>Help mode automatically creates a hyperlink when a documentation string
uses a single-quoted symbol name, if the symbol has either a
function or a variable definition.  You do not need to do anything
special to make use of this feature.  However, when a symbol has both a
function definition and a variable definition, and you want to refer to
just one of them, you can specify which one by writing one of the words
&lsquo;<samp>variable</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>option</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>function</samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp>command</samp>&rsquo;,
immediately before the symbol name.  (Case makes no difference in
recognizing these indicator words.)  For example, if you write
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">This function sets the variable `buffer-file-name'.
</pre></div>

<p>then the hyperlink will refer only to the variable documentation of
<code>buffer-file-name</code>, and not to its function documentation.
</p>
<p>If a symbol has a function definition and/or a variable definition, but
those are irrelevant to the use of the symbol that you are documenting,
you can write the words &lsquo;<samp>symbol</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>program</samp>&rsquo; before the
symbol name to prevent making any hyperlink.  For example,
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">If the argument KIND-OF-RESULT is the symbol `list',
this function returns a list of all the objects
that satisfy the criterion.
</pre></div>

<p>does not make a hyperlink to the documentation, irrelevant here, of the
function <code>list</code>.
</p>
<p>Normally, no hyperlink is made for a variable without variable
documentation.  You can force a hyperlink for such variables by
preceding them with one of the words &lsquo;<samp>variable</samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp>option</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Hyperlinks for faces are only made if the face name is preceded or
followed by the word &lsquo;<samp>face</samp>&rsquo;.  In that case, only the face
documentation will be shown, even if the symbol is also defined as a
variable or as a function.
</p>
<p>To make a hyperlink to Info documentation, write the single-quoted
name of the Info node (or anchor), preceded by
&lsquo;<samp>info node</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>Info node</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>info anchor</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>Info
anchor</samp>&rsquo;.  The Info file name defaults to &lsquo;<samp>emacs</samp>&rsquo;.  For example,
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">See Info node `Font Lock' and Info node `(elisp)Font Lock Basics'.
</pre></div>

<p>To make a hyperlink to a man page, write the single-quoted name of the
man page, preceded by &lsquo;<samp>Man page</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>man page</samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp>man
page for</samp>&rsquo;.  For example,
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">See the man page `chmod(1)' for details.
</pre></div>

<p>The Info documentation is always preferable to man pages, so be sure
to link to an Info manual where available.  For example,
<code>chmod</code> is documented in the GNU Coreutils manual, so it is
better to link to that instead of the man page.
</p>
<p>To link to a customization group, write the single-quoted name of the
group, preceded by &lsquo;<samp>customization group</samp>&rsquo; (the first character in
each word is case-insensitive).  For example,
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">See the customization group `whitespace' for details.
</pre></div>

<p>Finally, to create a hyperlink to URLs, write the single-quoted URL,
preceded by &lsquo;<samp>URL</samp>&rsquo;.  For example,
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">The GNU project website has more information (see URL
`https://www.gnu.org/').
</pre></div>

</li><li> Don&rsquo;t write key sequences directly in documentation strings.  Instead,
use the &lsquo;<samp>\\[&hellip;]</samp>&rsquo; construct to stand for them.  For example,
instead of writing &lsquo;<samp>C-f</samp>&rsquo;, write the construct
&lsquo;<samp>\\[forward-char]</samp>&rsquo;.  When Emacs displays the documentation string,
it substitutes whatever key is currently bound to <code>forward-char</code>.
(This is normally &lsquo;<samp>C-f</samp>&rsquo;, but it may be some other character if the
user has moved key bindings.)  See <a href="Keys-in-Documentation.html">Substituting Key Bindings in Documentation</a>.

</li><li> In documentation strings for a major mode, you will want to refer to
the key bindings of that mode&rsquo;s local map, rather than global ones.
Therefore, use the construct &lsquo;<samp>\\&lt;&hellip;&gt;</samp>&rsquo; once in the
documentation string to specify which key map to use.  Do this before
the first use of &lsquo;<samp>\\[&hellip;]</samp>&rsquo;, and not in the middle of a
sentence (since if the map is not loaded, the reference to the map
will be replaced with a sentence saying the map is not currently
defined).  The text inside the &lsquo;<samp>\\&lt;&hellip;&gt;</samp>&rsquo; should be the name
of the variable containing the local keymap for the major mode.

<p>Each use of &lsquo;<samp>\\[&hellip;]</samp>&rsquo; slows the display of the documentation
string by a tiny amount.  If you use a lot of them, these tiny
slowdowns will add up, and might become tangible, especially on slow
systems.  So our recommendation is not to over-use them; e.g., try to
avoid using more than one reference to the same command in the same
doc string.
</p>
</li><li> For consistency, phrase the verb in the first sentence of a function&rsquo;s
documentation string as an imperative&mdash;for instance, use &ldquo;Return the
cons of A and B.&rdquo; in preference to &ldquo;Returns the cons of A and B.&rdquo;
Usually it looks good to do likewise for the rest of the first
paragraph.  Subsequent paragraphs usually look better if each sentence
is indicative and has a proper subject.

</li><li> The documentation string for a function that is a yes-or-no predicate
should start with words such as &ldquo;Return t if&rdquo;, to indicate
explicitly what constitutes truth.  The word &ldquo;return&rdquo; avoids
starting the sentence with lower-case &ldquo;t&rdquo;, which could be somewhat
distracting.

</li><li> Write documentation strings in the active voice, not the passive, and in
the present tense, not the future.  For instance, use &ldquo;Return a list
containing A and B.&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;A list containing A and B will be
returned.&rdquo;

</li><li> Avoid using the word &ldquo;cause&rdquo; (or its equivalents) unnecessarily.
Instead of, &ldquo;Cause Emacs to display text in boldface&rdquo;, write just
&ldquo;Display text in boldface&rdquo;.

</li><li> Avoid using &ldquo;iff&rdquo; (a mathematics term meaning &ldquo;if and only if&rdquo;),
since many people are unfamiliar with it and mistake it for a typo.  In
most cases, the meaning is clear with just &ldquo;if&rdquo;.  Otherwise, try to
find an alternate phrasing that conveys the meaning.

</li><li> Try to avoid using abbreviations such as &ldquo;e.g.&rdquo; (for &ldquo;for
example&rdquo;), &ldquo;i.e.&rdquo; (for &ldquo;that is&rdquo;), &ldquo;no.&rdquo; (for &ldquo;number&rdquo;),
&ldquo;cf.&rdquo; (for &ldquo;compare&rdquo;/&ldquo;see also&rdquo;) and &ldquo;w.r.t.&rdquo; (for &ldquo;with respect
to&rdquo;) as much as possible.  It is almost always clearer and easier to
read the expanded version.<a id="DOCF36" href="#FOOT36"><sup>36</sup></a>

</li><li> When a command is meaningful only in a certain mode or situation,
do mention that in the documentation string.  For example,
the documentation of <code>dired-find-file</code> is:

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">In Dired, visit the file or directory named on this line.
</pre></div>

</li><li> When you define a variable that represents an option users might want
to set, use <code>defcustom</code>.  See <a href="Defining-Variables.html">Defining Global Variables</a>.

</li><li> The documentation string for a variable that is a yes-or-no flag should
start with words such as &ldquo;Non-nil means&rdquo;, to make it clear that
all non-<code>nil</code> values are equivalent and indicate explicitly what
<code>nil</code> and non-<code>nil</code> mean.

</li><li> If a line in a documentation string begins with an open-parenthesis,
consider writing a backslash before the open-parenthesis, like this:

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">The argument FOO can be either a number
\(a buffer position) or a string (a file name).
</pre></div>

<p>This avoids a bug in Emacs versions older than 27.1, where the
&lsquo;<samp>(</samp>&rsquo; was treated as the start of a defun
(see <a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Defuns.html#Defuns">Defuns</a> in <cite>The GNU Emacs Manual</cite>).
If you do not anticipate anyone editing your code with older Emacs
versions, there is no need for this work-around.
