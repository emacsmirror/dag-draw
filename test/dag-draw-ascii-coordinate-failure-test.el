;;; Commentary:

;; FUTURE ENHANCEMENT - Development/Debugging Tool
;;
;; Enhancement Category: Debug
;; Baseline Status: 🔧 Development Tool (Not part of baseline algorithm)
;;
;; This test verifies:
;; - ASCII coordinate failure case reproduction and analysis
;; - Node trampling detection in ASCII rendering
;; - Visual anomaly validation (GKNV aesthetic A2)
;;
;; Related Baseline Decisions: D5.x (ASCII Rendering)
;; Enhancement Source: Development debugging tools
;;
;; This is a development/debugging test, not part of the baseline specification.
;; May be useful for troubleshooting coordinate issues during implementation.
;; See doc/test-suite-analysis.md (Category B2) for categorization rationale.
;;
;; [Original commentary: This test captures the exact failure shown by the user...]
;;
;; This test captures the exact failure shown by the user:
;; ASCII coordinate mode produces trampled nodes where ranks collapse into each other.
;; This violates GKNV aesthetic A2 (avoid visual anomalies).
